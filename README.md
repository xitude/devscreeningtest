# D3R Screening Test

Thank you for your interest in working with D3R.

We are passionate about the work we do and have built a reputation on
the high quality of our thinking, delivery and client satisfaction.

We are looking to recruit brilliant individuals who are highly skilled
and highly motivated to work with us to continue to achieve this.

You should find the following files in this archive:

- ./example.css
- ./example.html
- ./example.php
- ./readme.txt
- ./your_code_samples/

We have put together a number of questions based around these files
in order to give us a basic understanding of your skills.


## Instructions

1. Run through each file in this folder adding your comments/answers.
2. Chuck a couple of code samples to the /your_code_samples folder.
3. Zip the whole thing up using your name as the filename.
4. Email your archive back to us.


Please just skip over anything you are not familiar with. We are
looking for a rough idea here and do not expect everyone to answer
everything.

Thank you for your time!
